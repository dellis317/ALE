"""Bidirectional sync — the platform layer for applying and maintaining Agentic Libraries.

This package provides the primitives for:
- Policy-as-code: machine-enforceable rules governing change application
- Provenance: auditable records of what was applied, when, why, and by whom
- Drift detection: detecting divergence between library intent and repo reality
- Rollback: safely reverting applied changes
